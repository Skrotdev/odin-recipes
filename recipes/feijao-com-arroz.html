    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Feijão com arroz is one of the most classic Brazilian comfort meals. It
      combines creamy black beans, fluffy white rice, and farofa for a perfect
      balance of flavor and texture. This dish comes straight from my wife’s
      Brazilian kitchen, a simple everyday recipe that somehow tastes amazing
      every single time.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound dry black beans</li>
      <li>4 slices bacon</li>
      <li>1 small-medium onion diced</li>
      <li>5-6 cloves garlic pressed or minced</li>
      <li>
        4 cups vegetable broth can use chicken or beef, or even water instead
      </li>
      <li>1 cup water more if desired, for “soupier” beans</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>cooked white rice for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place beans in a fine mesh strainer and pick out any shriveled ones, along with any impurities. Rinse clean.</li>
      <li>Heat pressure cooker to medium-high heat (sauté setting for electric pressure cooker, medium heat on stove top for regular pressure cooker). While pot is heating, cut bacon into about 1/2-inch pieces. Cook bacon until lightly browned and starting to crisp. Add diced onion and cook, stirring often for 3-4 minutes. Add garlic and stir for about 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>Add beans, broth and water, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine and secure lid. Cook on high pressure for 40 minutes, and then use natural release, for 15-20 minutes. If desired, lightly smash some beans on the side of the pot (this will thicken them), season with additional salt and pepper if desired, and let cool for a few minutes before serving. Serve over white rice.</li>
