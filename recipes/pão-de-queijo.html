    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pão de queijo is a popular Brazilian cheese bread made with tapioca flour,
      giving it a soft, chewy texture and a delicious cheesy flavor.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
      <li>
        80 ml extra virgin olive oil, plus a little extra for greasing the pan
      </li>
      <li>160 ml milk</li>
      <li>170 g tapioca flour</li>
      <li>66 g grated or crumbled cheese of your choice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon (ca 5 ml) salt, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 200°C. Lightly grease the cups of a non-stick mini
        muffin tin with olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the egg, olive oil, milk, tapioca flour, cheese, and salt to a
        blender. Blend until the batter is smooth, scraping down the sides if
        needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you like, you can cover the batter and keep it in the fridge for up
        to 1 week. Let it come back to room temperature and whisk it before
        baking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the batter into the prepared mini muffin tin, filling each cup
        almost to the top, leaving about 3 mm of space.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 15–20 minutes, or until the breads are puffed and nicely golden
        brown. Let them cool on a rack for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve warm or at room temperature. Store leftovers in an airtight
        container (1 day at room temp, up to 1 week in the fridge, or up to 1
        month in the freezer) and reheat briefly before eating.
      </li>
    </ol>
