    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Alfajores are soft, delicate cookies filled with dulce de leche and rolled
      in coconut. They are popular in many South American countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recipe comes from my wife’s Brazilian kitchen. She bakes them, I just
      eat them
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>all-purpose flour 200 gram</li>
      <li>cornstarch 300 gram</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>unsalted butter 200 gram (at room temperature)</li>
      <li>granulated sugar or powdered sugar 150 gram</li>
      <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>dulce de leche for filling 350 gram</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder,
        and baking soda. Set the dry mixture aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the
        butter and sugar on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
        Add the egg yolks and vanilla and mix just until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the mixer to low and slowly add the dry ingredients. Mix only until
        the dough comes together. If it feels too dry or crumbly, add a tiny
        splash of cold water or milk, a little at a time, until it holds
        together. Avoid overmixing so the cookies stay tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the dough into a ball, then press it into a flat disc. Wrap it in
        plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 1–2 hours, or until firm enough
        to roll out.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you’re making the dough ahead, you can keep it in the fridge for up
        to 3 days or freeze it for up to 1 month. Thaw frozen dough overnight in
        the fridge before using.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take the dough out of the fridge and let it rest on the counter for a
        few minutes so it softens slightly. On a lightly floured surface (or
        between two sheets of baking paper), roll it out to about 3–5 mm (⅛–¼
        inch) thick. Cut out circles with a 5 cm (2 inch) round or fluted cutter
        and place them on baking trays lined with parchment.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the dough gets too soft while you’re working, pop it back into the
        fridge for a short chill. Gather and re-roll the scraps as needed. Place
        the trays with the cut cookies in the fridge or freezer for at least 15
        minutes so they hold their shape in the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 177°C. Bake the cookies for 7–10 minutes, or
        until the edges just start to turn golden. Let them cool on the tray for
        about 10 minutes, then move them carefully to a wire rack to cool
        completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the cookies are cool, spread about a teaspoon of dulce de leche on
        the bottom of half of them. Top with the remaining cookies to make
        sandwiches, gently pressing so a little caramel squeezes out around the
        edges. Roll the sticky edges in shredded coconut.
      </li>
      <li>
        Store the finished alfajores in an airtight container at room
        temperature for up to 1 week, or freeze for up to 2 months. To thaw
        frozen cookies, leave them covered on the counter or in the fridge
        overnight.
